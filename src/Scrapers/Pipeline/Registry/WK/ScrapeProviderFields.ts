/**
 * Provider-annotation field aliases — the descriptive fields a row carries
 * alongside its date/amount/description core.
 *
 * Split out of {@link ./ScrapeFieldMappings.js} to keep that module under the
 * 150-line `max-lines` ceiling, following the precedent already set there by
 * {@link ./ScrapeIdFields.js} and {@link ./ScrapeMonthlyFields.js}.
 *
 * Each group is spread back into `PIPELINE_WELL_KNOWN_TXN_FIELDS`, so callers
 * see one dictionary and covering another institution stays a one-line edit
 * here.
 *
 * Evidence cited per alias is a captured forensic run under
 * `C:\tmp\runs\pipeline\<bank>\`; counts are rows carrying a non-empty value.
 *
 * Institution sweep — all 12 supported providers were checked against captured
 * rows (or, where a provider is headless and emits no network dump, against the
 * closed query contract it ships). The eight not aliased here are covered or
 * genuinely have nothing to add:
 *
 * - Max: sends `categoryId` (numeric) and `planName` ("רגילה"), a charge kind
 *   rather than a sector — the same reason VisaCal's `trnType` is excluded.
 * - Hapoalim: its beneficiary block is a composite, handled in RestoredFields.
 * - Beinleumi: its only free-text fields are `Name`/`CustomerName`, which hold
 *   the account holder's own name — PII, and of no value on a row.
 * - Yahav: the corpus carries no transaction rows, only an error-code table.
 * - PayBox: its shape emits `memo` directly, before the auto-mapper runs.
 * - OneZero: `categories` are numeric ids; its detail unions carry only
 *   i18n description keys, already consumed as `description`.
 * - Pepper: closed 10-field contract; `title`/`subTitle` are candidates but no
 *   captured value exists to justify a precedence order, so neither is added.
 * - Leumi/Discount/Isracard/Amex/VisaCal are aliased above.

/**
 * Free-text note the provider attaches to a row. Populates
 * {@link ITransaction.memo}, which had no WK entry at all, so the shared
 * auto-mapper dropped it for every institution.
 *
 * Order is precedence: the first alias a record carries wins. Each entry is
 * specific enough that it cannot fire for a provider that does not send it,
 * which is what lets one list serve every bank.
 *
 * Two providers need a shape rather than a key — a nested beneficiary block
 * and a comment array — and are handled in
 * {@link "../../Mediator/Scrape/TxnMapper/RestoredFields.js"} instead.
