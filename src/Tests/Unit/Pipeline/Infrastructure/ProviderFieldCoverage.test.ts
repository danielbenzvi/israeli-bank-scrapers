/**
 * Provider-annotation coverage, one row shape per institution.
 *
 * {@link "../../../../Scrapers/Pipeline/Mediator/Scrape/TxnMapper/RestoredFields.js"}
 * and the `memo`/`category`/`chargedCurrency` Well-Known groups are only
 * useful if the alias each institution actually sends is in the dictionary. A
 * unit test built from invented key names cannot show that: it passes just as
 * happily against a dictionary that covers no real bank.
 *
 * So the table below carries key names lifted verbatim from captured forensic
 * runs under `C:\tmp\runs\pipeline\<bank>\`, one entry per institution whose
 * capture carries the field, with the row count that backs it. Values are
 * synthetic; only the shape is real. A bank losing coverage — because an alias
 * was renamed, reordered behind a more general one, or dropped — fails here.
 *
 * Cross-bank by construction rather than one file per bank: the dictionary is
 * shared, so the interesting failure is "this alias stopped resolving", which
 * is the same assertion for every institution.
